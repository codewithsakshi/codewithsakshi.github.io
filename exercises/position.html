  <h1>CSS Position Types Demo</h1>
  
  <div id="parent-container" class="a">
    I am the ancestor of all the boxes inside me. Also, I am positioned relatively. What is affected if I were static?
    <div id="static"class="b">static positioning means that this element is <i>unpositioned</i>. It is rendered where the element is by default according to the HTML. It's not participating in all the positioning fun.
  
      <!-- <div class="sub-container-1 absolute e">
        this absolutely-positioned element has <i>escaped</i> its static parent element.</br>It is now positioned relative to its nearest relative ancestor.
      </div> -->
  
    </div>
  
    <div id="relative" class="c">relative positioning means the element is positioned relative to itself. Without using the top, right, bottom, or left properties, it behaves like a <span>static</span> element. Try adding
      properties to move this element!
  
      <div class="sub-container-2 absolute f">absolute means positioned relative to its nearest <i>positioned</i> parent positioned element. Uncomment the following HTML!
        
      </div>
  
    </div>
  
    <!-- <div id="fixed" class="d">
      fixed positioning means that I am positioned relative to the browser window a.k.a the viewport. Even if you scroll, I'll be right here. PS - extra info in the HTML!
    </div> -->
  
  </div>
